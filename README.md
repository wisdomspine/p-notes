# PNotes

With PNotes, you can jot down important ideas and access your notes from different devices at any time.
With just a click and either your Google or Twitter account, you can experience all that PNotes has for you. You can group related notes to form a notebook (just as you would for different courses).
PNotes allows you to style your ideas in a way that will improve comprehension when next you check your notes. Also, you can add beautiful photos and code snippets to your notes.
And once youâ€™re done, you can export your notes to PDF or print directly with a connected or wireless printer.
